C is a middle level programming language
1. C is not object oriented
2. C++ is an extension for C
3. C is difficult

We will need only an IDE and GCC compiler

First always put #  (predecessor) include (directive)  < std (standard) io (input and output) > (standard file) 
int main() {
	print formatted -> printf("Hello world\n");
	error code -> return 0; 
}

escape sequence | \n -> for newline | \t -> for tab
variable -> Allocated space in memory to store a value. We refer a variable name to access the stored value. That variable now behaves as if it was the value contains. BUT we need to declare what type of data we are storing. Variable must be declarative and initialized
char wo[] = "World";
printf("Hello %c")

printf("%c\n", a); // char
char name [lenght];
fgets(name, 25, stdin);
name[strlen(name) - 1] = '\0';
scanf("%d(format)", &age(address)); //for other data types and formats

### Compile programas with library name

gcc archivo.c -o exec -l< library name > -l< other library name >
libc -> c classic library / -lc
libm -> math library / -lm
libpthreatd -> multithread library / -lpthread
libstring -> strings / -lc
libsocket -> sockets library / -lsocket
libsqlite3 -> sqlite library / -lsqlite3
lib< picture extension > -> picture compatibility / -lpng | -ljpeg
libcurl -> http operations / -lcurl
libxml2 -> RWM xml files / -lxml2
OpenSSL -> connect with secure shell / -lssl -lcrypto

if (condition) {
        printf("Actions to do");
    } else if (Specific condition) {
        printf("Actions to do");
    } else if (age == 17) {
        printf("You are so close to sing up!\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are too young to sing up!\n");
    }
switch (variable){
    case 'A':
        printf("You did perfect!\n");
        break;
    case 'B':
        printf("You did good\n");
        break;
    case 'C':
        printf("You did okay!\n");
        break;
    case 'D':
        printf("At least it's not an F!\n");
        break;
    case 'F':
        printf("YOU FAILED\n");
    default:
        printf("Please enter only valid grades\n");
    }
}
